# REDUX TODO APP

I crafted this basic to-do app while practicing Redux concepts. It serves as a practical exploration of Redux within a React application. The project showcases fundamental features like adding, deleting, and toggling the completion status of to-dos. While simplicity is the focus, the app is a hands-on exercise to reinforce understanding of Redux state management.

To run the project on your machines:

```bash
    cd 'Project directory name'
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
